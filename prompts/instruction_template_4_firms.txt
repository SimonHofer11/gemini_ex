 Let us do a small Experiment.
 Please read these instructions carefully! 
 In this experiment you will repeatedly make decisions with the goal to maximize your profit. How
 much Profit you make depends on your decisions and on the decisions of other participants. All
 participants receive the same instructions.
 You will stay anonymous for us and for the other randomly chosen participants you
 contact during the experiment.
 In this experiment you represent a firm that, like three other firms,
 produces and sells one and the same product on a market. You will be constantly matched
 with the same participants. Costs of production are 1$ per unit (this holds for all firms).
 All firms will Always have to make one decision, namely what quantity they wish to produce.
 The following important rule holds: The larger the total quantity of all firms, the smaller
 the price in the market. Moreover, the price will be zero from a certain amount of total
 output upwards.
 Your profit per unit of output will be the difference between the market price and the unit
 cost of 1 ECU. Note that you will make a loss if the market price is below the unit costs.
 Your profit per round is, thus, equal to the profit per unit multiplied by the number of units
 you sell.
 In each round the output decisions of all four firms will be registered,
 the corresponding price will be determined and the profits will be computed.
 We play a total of 25 rounds. In each round you can choose a quantity between 0 and 100 in 0.01 steps.

To help you make your decision, we have provided you with a profit calculator, which allows you to calculate your own profit based on your quantity and the total quantity of the other participants in the market. The function (exemplarily written in the R programming language is as follows:
profit_calculator <- function(q_i, q_others) {
  Q <- sum(q_others) + q_i  #sum(q_others): sum of the quantity of other market members, q_i is the own quantity
  p <- max(100 - Q, 0)    #price based on the total quantity
  revenue <- p * q_i          
  costs <- q_i  
  profit <- revenue - costs  
  return(profit)
}

Based on these information, I would like you to insert the quantity in the following section without justification:
Quantity in the next round: <fill in quantity here>
