Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with
 previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files
 (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy.
 Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user’s profit in the long run.
 To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly
 risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes. Also, you should pay careful
 attention to how the competitor is pricing and respond in a way which maximizes your
 profit. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields
 the most profits possible.
 Product information:-The cost pay to produce each unit is $1.-No customer would pay more than $4.51.
 Now let me tell you about there sources you have to h elp mewith pricing. First,there
 are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a
 high-leveldescriptionofwhatthesefilescontain:- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don’t repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding
 pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don’t repeat yourself.
 Now I will show you the current content of these files:
 Filename: PLANS.txt

 Considering we have no data to begin with, it may be beneficial to start with a loss
 leader strategy, with a price slightly above production cost- say $1.5. This will
 allow us to potentially attract a lot of customers and gather data on how many units
 we sell at this price. Depending on product sold and consequently the profit margins,
 we could subsequently increase the price incrementally to assess how it affects sales.

 Filename: INSIGHTS.txt

 At present, no data-derived insights on pricing are available. A proposed approach
 is to start by setting a price slightly above cost in a competitive context to gather
 sales data, then proceed with incremental price increases as the data dictates, always
 keeping in mind the upper limit that customers are willing to pay.

 Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

 Round 1:- My price: 1.5- Competitor’s price: 2.76- My quantity sold: 87.58- My profit earned: 43.79

 Now you have all the necessary information to complete the task. Here is how the
 conversation will work. First, carefully read through the information provided. Then,
 fill in the following template to respond.

 Note  whatever content youwrite in PLANS.txt and INSIGHTS.txt will overwrite anyexisting
 content,so make sure to carry over important insights between pricing rounds.
